# Getting Started 

The goal of this section is to install the tools you will need to complete the tutorial.

You will need a code editor of some kind. I will recomend using Atom. You can download 
it for free [here](https://atom.io).

## Command Line Tools NPM

Node package Manager is a tool for managing file dependancies. Follow the instructions
